## Positive points
1. About 2.25 crore pregnant women and lactating mothers are expected to benefit from the legislation that proposes to give Rs. 1,000 per month for six months as maternity benefit. 

2.  Aiming to empower women, the Bill also proposes that the ration card will be issued to the eldest female member of the family. The proposed Bill also holds great promises for children. Children in the lower and upper primary classes would be entitled to mid-day meals as per the prescribed nutritional norms.

3. States will have to fully computerise their PDS within two years of the law and they “shall provide a toll-free number and a website where consumers can register their complaints. All complaints shall be addressed within 39 days of receipt and records of the same shall be made available in the public domain, including the Internet,” 

4. For the first time, the onus of identification and, more crucially, delivery of grain to consumers could be pinned on panchayats in rural areas and local governments in urban areas, entailing never-before accountability on records of allocation and off-take of grain.

5. The successes of conditional transfers such as Bolsa Famila in Brazil and Progressa in Mexico are well known. Recent research from Africa have also shown positive impacts of unconditional transfers in terms of reducing hunger, increasing livestock holdings and investment in new trades (Blattman, Fiala and Martinez 2013, Haushofer and Shapiro 2013).

6. **Bill seeks to utilize already existing infrastructures like PDS and aganwadi’s**. This has prevented further wastage of money to develop the infrastructures.

7. **Continuance of Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY)** – Protection to 2.43 crore poorest of poor families under the Antodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) to supply of 35 kg foodgrains per month per family would continue.

8. **Right to food to become a legal right**– The proposed bill aims to provide legal right over subsidised foodgrain to 67 per cent of the population.
9. Inflation is on the rise, this is the time poor people need food security.

## Suggestions

SUGGESTIONS:

1. We should have learned lessons from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (which provides 100 days of work to the poor at 100 rupees a day) and strengthened it to make it more effective to help the very poorest. Those who are part of that program should be targeted for this subsidy.
2. Or we could link it to education as they did in Bangladesh where school children and their families were given access to subsidized food.
3. The bill should have included subsidized rates for pulses which for many of the poorest are their only source of protein and highly nutritious. The price of pulses has gone up, making them out of reach for many.
4. We need to reduce the leakages from the distribution system and make it transparent. This bill has transparency provisions but do not provide how this transparency shall be achieved.
5. Community based agricultural programs and teaching about sustainable farming shall enhance production in the country. And this in turn would bring down the prices of various essential commodities and people can be self sufficient themselves. Relieance on government programs would reduce and this would give people a feeling of security and not fear of dependence.
6. For reducing loopholes in PDS system government must take lessons from Chattisgarh government where after the delivery is made to PDS branch, all the beneficiaries get a message though mobiles about the same, so they know about it and reach to PDS branch on time.
